This App was made to help people remember their Commits!

As a junior dev, one of the things I always forget to do is to commit my work. This is risky and so, to avoid this uncomfortable situation I've been tasked with creating this tiny desktop app to remind myself, and the rest of my team to commit every now and then.

the default interval for the reminder is 90 minutes.
to change it, simply go to renderer.js and change the value in the timedNotification function.
